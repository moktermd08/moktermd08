👋 Hello there,\
I studied for my MSc in Software Engineering at Oxford University in 2013 and led the companies' business in London, Bangladesh, India, Ukraine during that time. I was responsible for running the Tech teams consisting of Programmers and Designers.

I have been coding for over 17 years now and love to help online businesses develop and operate more smoothly and efficiently. 

Whilst freelancing, I had the invaluable opportunity of working alongside David Axmark, the Founder of MySQL, which helped my knowledge grow immensely.

Prior, I worked for numerous companies such as BBC, Mitsubishi, Allsaints Spitalfield, Red Group plc, and TheToyshop. Although I have seen both the best of web technologies and the worst, working full-time and freelance has taught me some essential lessons in the IT service industry.

My Expertise : 
1. 🫱 Discussion /Briefing / Client Communication 
2. ✍️ Project Management 
3. 🧑🏻‍🏫 Create Technical details
4. 👉🏻 Outline details for the project manager (sprint + to-do list )
5. 🧑🏽‍💻 Engineering (Frontend, Backend, Database )
6. 🥷🏽 Testing & Debugging
7. 🚀 Launching

I am mainly a backend developer (PHP, MySQL, Linux), but if needed could give my hands to any development situation.

My main focus is always getting the job done hence do not mind going outside my comfort zone and working on technologies that I have never used before.


I believe in open source project and 💞️ happy to help on any large scale project with enterprise project consultancy software architecture, project management, software development
