Greetings,\

I completed my MSc in Software Engineering from Oxford University in 2013, and during that time, I oversaw the business operations of companies in London, Bangladesh, India, and Ukraine. As the head of Tech teams comprising programmers and designers, I ensured smooth functioning and delivery of services.

With over 17 years of coding experience, I enjoy assisting online businesses in enhancing their efficiency and streamlining their operations.\

During my freelancing stint, I had the privilege of working alongside David Axmark, the Founder of MySQL, which immensely boosted my knowledge and skills.

Prior to this, I worked with several renowned organizations such as BBC, Mitsubishi, Allsaints Spitalfield, Red Group plc, and TheToyshop, where I encountered both the best and worst of web technologies. My experiences of working full-time and as a freelancer have taught me some crucial lessons in the IT service industry.\

My expertise includes discussion/briefing/client communication, project management, creating technical details, outlining project details for the project manager (sprint + to-do list), engineering (frontend, backend, database), testing, debugging, and launching. Although I specialize in backend development (PHP, MySQL, Linux), I am open to helping with any development situation.\

My focus is always on delivering the project on time, and therefore, I do not hesitate to step outside my comfort zone and work on technologies that are new to me.\

I strongly believe in open-source projects and would be delighted to assist in any large-scale project by providing enterprise project consultancy, software architecture, project management, and software development services.\
