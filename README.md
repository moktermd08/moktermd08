👋 Hello there,\
Thank you for taking the time to read my details. My name is Mo from London. My programming life started as a web developer internship at Kingsland car in 2005. Over the last 17+ years, I have worked in many roles for many amazing companies in various roles, mostly as a backend developer. I have had the opportunity to work on various projects in various sectors.

Although my career started as full-time employment, for the last 14+ years 🌱,  I have worked in an agency setup where my company used to assign various projects to me for different small to large corporations.

I normally get involved in most parts of the projects
1. Discussion /Briefing
2. Create Technical details
3. Outline details for the project manager (sprint + to-do list )
4. Engineering (Frontend, Backend, Database )
5. Testing & Debugging
6. Launching

I am mainly a backend developer (PHP, MySQL, Linux), but if needed could give my hands to any development situation.

My main focus is always getting the job done hence do not mind going outside my comfort zone and working on technologies that I have never used before.

I believe in open source project and 💞️ happy to help on any large scale project with enterprise project consultancy software architecture, project management, software development

I shall look forward to hearing from you.

Thank you\
Mo\
